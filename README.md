(Except I dunno if it's team (" or not and that does not matter right now)
for Ludum Dare #36 game jam, team version

Theme: Ancient Technology

Concept/Gameplay:  escape from ancient technology spaceship

you get warped there as part of "something" and have to escape

ship consists of rooms (maybe roguelike/random generated) and the rooms have
resources and puzzles on the door and you have to escape the spaceship to get
outside (where you can be eaten by monsters or something.)

technologies are old computers, phones, floppy disks, cassette tapes,
typewriters with written messages, etc.
